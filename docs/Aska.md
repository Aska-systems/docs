`Aska v1.x` will no longer be supported and be deleted after v2.x is launched. Moreover, `Aska v1.x` is completely independent and the user accounts are not managed under Handler.


## How it works?

Aska apps are survey frameworks that are suitable for open-ended questions. 

Users respond by posting their own opinions and selecting the opinions that they agree with (just like you often do in social network services). Machine-learning algorithms nicely categorize&align the collected opinions based on these user activities.
