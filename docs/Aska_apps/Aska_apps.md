# Aska apps

Aska apps are survey frameworks that are suitable for open-ended questions. 
<!-- Users respond by posting their own opinions and selecting the opinions that they agree with (just like you often do in social network services). Machine-learning algorithms nicely categorize&align the collected opinions based on these user activities.  -->
